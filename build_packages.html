	<h2><a id="intro"></a>Introduction to Debian packages</h2>
	<p>
	  Debian packages are <strong><em>ar</em></strong> archives that contains normally two files :
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><strong>control.tar.gz</strong>: This archive contains informations about the package (version, dependencies, descriptions, ...).</li>
	  <li><strong>data.tar.gz</strong>: This archive contains all the files that will be installed.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  There are mainly 4 types of packages (or at least, there's 4 of them that will interest us here) :
	  </p>
	<ul style='list-style-type:decimal;'>
	  <li>
	    <em>Binary packages</em>:<br />
	    This concerns the packages that contains binary files. They depend on the architecture they were built on. They're generally named according to the following pattern: <span class='courier'>&lt;package_name&gt;_&lt;version&gt;-1_&lt;arch&gt;.deb</span>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <em>Library packages</em>:<br />
	    This packages concerns libraries and headers files. Library packages can be divided into two categories :
	    <ul style='list-style-type:lower-roman;'>
	      <li>The first category of library packages concerns the ones which only contains libraries. They're named according to the following pattern: <span class='courier'>&lt;package_name&gt;_&lt;version&gt;-1_&lt;arch&gt;.deb</span>. Usually, the name of the package contains 'lib', but it's not mandatory.</li>
	      <li>The second category concerns the packages that only contains header files. Those packages are named according to the following pattern: <span class='courier'>&lt;package_name&gt;-dev_&lt;version&gt;-1_&lt;arch&gt;.deb.</span></li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <em>Arch-Independant packages</em>:<br />
	    Those packages contains files that don't depend on the architecture on which the package was built. This category of files includes images, scripts, configuration files, ...
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <em>Sources packages</em>:<br />
	    Sources packages are actually composed of two files : a <span class='courier'>.dsc</span> file which describe the package, and a tarball (an archive which format usually is <span class='courier'>.tar.[gbx]z</span>). This type of package allows you to build one of the three other types, and is usually generated during a package's build. 
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  Building packages is usually quite difficult. That's why we've created buildeb, a shell script that will help you build packages easily.
	</p>
	<h2><a id='buildeb'></a>Introduction to buildeb</h2>
	<p>
	  The purpose of buildeb is to help you create packages. In order to download it, you have to <a href='use_cosy_repo.html'>add the CosyVerif repository to your sources.list</a>. You can also clone the following git repository: <a href="https://github.com/CosyVerif/deb-base/">https://github.com/CosyVerif/deb-base</a>. However, in that case there's a few things you need to know. If you clone the git repository, you'll need to put the perl scripts (i.e. the files located in <span class='courier'>scripts/*.pl</span>) in the directory where you'll launch buildeb. So, it's probably better to just install the buildeb package.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  If you want to use buildeb, your project needs to follow some rules. You'll find them below.
